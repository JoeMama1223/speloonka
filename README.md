### A platformer for #js13k

![home screen](images/colerhome.gif)

Inspired by [Celeste PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145). Made in 10 days.

Play live at [JS13K entries]().

[Gameplay gif](https://twitter.com/eguneys/status/1299769426644959234?s=20).

Controls:

`Arrow keys` to move.
`X` to jump.
`Enter` to see status codes.

There are 4 levels, and 12 collectibles.
It is hard at first. There is wall jumping. And jump grace where you can still jump a few frames after you leave the ground, which you have to use to pass levels. Spikes have a smaller hit-box than they look.
